This game is a side-scrolling game in which you control a scuba diver to pick up all the trash in the ocean. To move, you must use the WASD keys. The scuba diver has two forms: Recycling and Trash. In the Recycling form, he can only pick up recyclable trash (water bottes, cans, egg cartons, etc.). Likewise, in Trash form, he can only pick up garbage that is non-recyclable (plastic bags, chip bags, etc.). Failure to pick up the correct type of garbage in a respective state will lead to the player losing one of his four health points. After reaching 0 health points, the player will lose the game. There is also a time limit to clear the round, and failure to do so in time will also result in a game over. This game has multiple states, starting from the Menu to the Instructions to the actual PlayState, along with a GameOver or You Win state. The game also contains three levels as well, where each level gets progressively difficult and the player has less time to complete it. "Scuba Trouble" should have enough complexity to be a fully fleshed-out game.
